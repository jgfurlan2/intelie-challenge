# Joao's Intelie Challenge

## Installing and running the project
To run the project, first clone this repository and install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Then run the command `npm run dev` or` yarn dev` to run the project.

## Technologies used in the project
- For this project I used React.JS with Typescript.
- For page styles I used the [Styled Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) and [Polished](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polished) for easy color management.
- I used [recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts) to generate the chart.
- To maintain a code standard I used ESLint with the react and typescript plugins.

## Other information
The project uses the typescript 'paths' through the component [@craco/craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco).

## Because of these technologies
I decided to use React.JS with Typescript as it is the technology that I have the most affinity with styled components and polished to develop the front-end.

I chose to use recharts because it was easier and more straightforward to work.
